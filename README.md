# The-Reservoir-Bank-Heist
 A project developed for the Oculus Quest 2 demonstrating the World in Miniature (WIM) navigation method.

# Introduction
## Narrative
Alright kid…welcome to the big leagues. No more small-time robberies, it’s time for you to work a bank heist. We’ve heard good things about you so far but none of that matters if you can’t perform here. All you gotta do is get us past the guards and to the vault. Once you do that, your job is done. You can sit back and relax. By now you should already be tapped in to the camera system. Those glasses you’ve got on will let you look through the cameras’ eyes and into the bank itself. Just pick a camera to link up with and you’re good to go. Watch the guards and find their blind spots. Give us a safe passage through and Mr. Red and I will handle the rest. Go ahead and get going if you’re ready. We’re ready and waiting on our safe way through. And remember, if you do this right, we’ll all be millionaires by the time we get outta here. Good luck kid. Mr. Green out.

## Gameplay
When you load into the environment you will see 6 screens in front of you in a van. You can use your right hand to tap one of the screens and your view will be swapped with the camera view on that screen. You can go back to the van by pressing the 'B' button on the right controller. Below is a video demonstrating the gameplay.
